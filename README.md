- [ ] 15-slide powerpoint analyzing (Circuit Breaker, PatternRetry Pattern/ Valetâ€“Key Pattern, Event Sourcing Pattern/ Event Sourcing Pattern, Retry Pattern/ Federated Identity Pattern, Event Sourcing Pattern) from [Cloud Design Patterns](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=42026) by Microsoft. Also, implement a class diagram and use cases for each design pattern. All the above will be based on the e-book's examples.
